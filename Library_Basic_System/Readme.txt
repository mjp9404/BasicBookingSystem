Project Title: Library System

What does the program do? 

The program loads the text file that contains the list of the books. It goes through a loop and assign it in an array list called books checking the isbn number and assigns a book type. Then the method display menu will be called to show the options the user has. The first method allows the users to checkout a book by entering the isbn number. The for loop checks the array list it there is a matching isbn number. If it matches, the output will show that the book has been checked out and decrements the total. If the total is zero, it will say book is not available. If it does not find an isbn number matching the user's input, it wil say invalid isbn number. The second method allows users to search for a book by entering the title, or just part of it. The loop checks the array list if there is a matching title from the user input. If it has a match, it will print out the result/s. If not, it will say invalid input. The third method lets the user to search books by their types. It will ask for a user to input a number according to the book type of their choice. The switch statement each has for loop to check the array list and look over the format from the array list. If it matches with the user's input, it will print out the results it finds. The fourth method generates random book/books according to the user's input. The last method overwrites the old text file depending on the changes made. 

How to run the program?
The first thing that the user is going to see is the menu option. It will ask for a number input. If the user  selects "Checkout Book", they have to enter the isbn number of the book they want to checkout. After that, they will be prompted where the book can be found. If hte user selects Find books by title, they have to enter the title of the book the wish to search for. After that, the matching books will be shown. The Display Books by type gets two more input from the user. One is the type of book they want, and the other is the type of book(it depends on what kind of book they selected). The last option lets the user get random book/s depending on how much books they wish to generate.
