Shape Sorting System

There are 6 sorts to choose from:
	Insert = i
	Selection = s
	Bubble = b
	Merge = m
	Quick = q 
	Gnome = z

Lists can be sorted by 1 of three variables:
	Height = h
	Volume = v
	Base Area = a

Run JAR file with three arguments
	1. "-f" then the file name where the array is located
	2. "-s" followed by the character representing the Sort you desire
	3. "-t" followed by the character representing the Sort Parameter you desire
